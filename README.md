expressionism

I want to understand the process of how high level Haskell code becomes low-level instructions.  There is a nice paper "Implementing Functional Languages: a Tutorial" by S. Peyton-Jones and D. Lester which walks you through many of the important ideas.  This project is where I am working through that paper.
